    <h2>Who is This Guy?</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm David Neuhaus: free thinker, amateur techie, avid shower singer, and future web developer. I'd like to think I'm too complex to summarize on this page, but here are some key facts:
    	<br>
    	I grew up on Long Island, and went to Queens College. I've driven cross country twice. I currently live on the Lower East Side with my wife and puggle. Sometimes I like to high five pedestrians trying to hail a cab when I ride by them on my bicycle. Before GA, I was an Architectural Sales Rep for a natural stone company. Now, I code fulltime. 
<br>
    	My favorite icecream flavor is pistachio. 
    </p>
    <p>
    	Pleased to meet you.
    </p>
